                It also does not help that I am a poor college student.

                The location I chose is South Korea. This is the first place I have chosen because my boyfriend is
                Korean and he has talked about wanting to introduce to compeltely new experience. I think it is sweet so
                I hope to humor him one day.

            <p> Japan has been a dream since I was little. Japan is an island country in East Asia located in the
                northwest Pacific Ocean. It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the west and extends from the Sea of
                Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south.
