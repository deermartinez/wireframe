        It certainly feels like this quarentine is going to last forever!

        Even though I'm sure you already have a list of what you're going to do after, I have a few more you should look
        into!

        <br>
        Why should you try try or introduce any of these activities to your yound adult?
        <br>
        A few reasons!
        <br>
    <ul>
        <li>They're <strong>great</strong> resume fillers</li>
        <li>They're all for a good, local cause</li>
        <li>You're going to have a strong support system</li>
        <li>I'm recommending them to you personally!</li>
    </ul>
    I've been involved with every organization listed here, and not only are their ambitions positive and for a good
    cause but they all have shown to have amazing treatment and support for their employees. It has been a true
    privilage to be involved with these people and companies as I have been and I hope I can share the good they're
    doing with others.
