                    <h2>What are we eating?</h2>
                    <p>Today you are going to learn how to make the most basic of the basic and maybe mildly depressing
                        mac and cheese. I'm sure I once took this from a really good recipe, but so much has been
                        forgotten that we now are stuck with this basic mess.</p>
                    <h4>Perfect for that broke college student who has no will to go on but just enough will to not find
                        Craft Mac and Cheese as an acceptable dinner option.</h4>

                <p>In order to get started we need to know what we need! The next time you are at the store make sure
                    you have all of these items.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>8 oz box of elbow macaroni(or any bite sized pasta)</li>
                    <li>Cheese of your choice</li>
                    <li>3 cups of milk</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup and 2 tablespoons of butter</li>

                <h2>Step 2-Complicated and annoyting but delicious</h2>
                <p>Cook the noodles as directed, with the replacement of milk instead of water.
                </p>
                <h4>Be careful!</h4>
                <p>Milk is a brat to cook with sometimes. <i>Do not</i> let it bubble and boil as you would with normal
                    water. Keep a close eye on it and your meal will treat you a lot better. </p>

                    <h2>Step 3</h2>
                    <p>As or after you cook the noodles, melt butter in a smaller suacepan. The flour is going to be
                        used to
                        thicken it just a little bit so add in as you deem necessary. Some find it weird so it's fully
                        your
                        choice but it's the bunk way to do things. </p>

                <h2>Step 4</h2>
                <p>Stir cheese aggressively and thoroughly and now serve! Don't wait for it to cool. If you don't burn
                    your tongue
                    then you're not embracing the broke student experience.

                    <strong>P.S.</strong>
                    <br>
                    If you want to know how to truly "student-fy" this even further, gallons of any kind of hot sauce is
                    your answer. That is my true spice and the only thing lining my stomach.
